        <img src="800px-The_Mansion,_Baguio_City.jpg" width= "590px" alt="">
        <p class="content2"><a href="http://www.gobaguio.com/the-mansion.html">The Mansion House</a> was built in 1908 to serve as the official summer residence of American Governors-General at the insistence of Governor-General William Cameron Forbes. The name is derived from the summer cottage in New England of Governor Forbes whose administration the original Mansion House was built under. Architect William E. Parsons, based on preliminary plans by architect Daniel H. Burnham,[2] the planner of the city of Baguio, designed the mountain retreat following the tenets of the City Beautiful Movement.[3] In 1910, the meeting of the Second Philippine Legislature was held at the Mansion House for three weeks.  With its historical representation, the Mansion is a must see place if you love tracing back your roots and checkin </p>

        <h1 class="rPosition">Our Lady of Lourdes Grotto</h1>
        <img src="Our Lady of Lourdes Baguio.jpg" width= "590px" alt="">
        <p class="content2"><a href="https://guidetothephilippines.ph/destinations-and-attractions/our-lady-of-lourdes-grotto">The Our Lady of Lourdes Grotto</a> is a Catholic shrine that sits on Mirador Hill in Baguio City. It was constructed in 1913 mainly out of limestone that was used to build the Mirador Jesuit Villa. Inside the grotto, you will find the Our Lady of Lourdes statue. This sculpture was created by the famous artist Isabelo Tampingco using polychromed molave. 
            Aside from serving as a place of worship, many tourists flock here for the scenic view of Baguio City that the grotto offers. To reach the grotto, you will have to climb up a stairway made up of around 252 steps which took five years to complete.
            However, it was later damaged in 1990 due to an earthquake that had affected Mirador Hill. Following the natural disaster, it was restored along with a center rail to provide assistance for elderly who wanted to visit the shrine. In 2007, a handicap route to the shrine was also laid out. </p>
